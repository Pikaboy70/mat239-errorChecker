Do not run main.py in its current state. 

Project is in progress on being migrated from multiple files to classes/subclasses in one file.
Some functions do not work as intended as they were not finished before this migration decision was made.

There most likely won't be any runtime errors that stop the program, it will just not return anything close to what it should.
